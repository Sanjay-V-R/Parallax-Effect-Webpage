            <h2>Parallax Scrolling Website</h2>
            <p>
                Parallax scrolling, which creates a sense of depth on your site, is
                powerful because it is so engaging. When looking through websites making
                use of this design effect, it's hard not to be inspired to implement it on
                your own website. <br /><br />Parallax scrolling is a visual effect where
                the background of a web page appears to stay still while the foreground
                shifts vertically or horizontally. Parallax scrolling is used to add
                visual interest to a website and engage users as they scroll through a web
                page. <br /><br />In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and
                background are moving, but the background typically moves much more
                slowly, giving the illusion of depth. Done correctly, parallax scrolling
                produces a fascinating and seamless virtual experience. <br /><br />
                If you want to add a parallax scrolling effect to your website, you should
                consider the following tips.
                <br /><br />
                <li>
                    Use it selectively. Parallax scrolling is much more powerful when you
                    use it on one particular element as opposed to all pages and all the
                    time. Use it in headers and titles, or maybe on your home page only.
                    You want parallax scrolling to strengthen your website's design, not
                    distract users.
                </li>
                <br /><br />
                <li>
                    Image compression is key. Parallax scrolling uses a variety of media
                    files and CSS shapes to create a sense of depth. You don't want to
                    compromise your web performance and user experience with large image
                    files that load too slowly.
                </li>
                <br /><br />
                <li>
                    Play with color. Parallax scrolling isn't just about the images in the
                    foreground and background, but about color, too. You might use more
                    desaturated tones in the background and more lively colors in the
                    foreground to create an even greater sense of depth.
                </li>
                <br /><br />
                Though there are several approaches to achieving a parallax scrolling
                effect, making the background move slower than the foreground is the most
                popular.
                <br /><br />
                A slower moving background embodies the same type of feeling as when you
                are inside a moving vehicle looking out: the sky and clouds in the
                background appear to move at a slower pace than the trees and houses in
                the foreground.
